This warning is Git‚Äôs way of telling you that **line endings** in your files are being changed from **LF (Line Feed)** to **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)**. This typically happens when you're working on Windows, which uses CRLF by default, while Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS) use LF.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Happens
Git tries to normalize line endings across platforms to avoid unnecessary diffs and merge conflicts. When you add files, Git may convert LF to CRLF depending on your configuration.

### üîß How to Fix or Control It

You can manage this behavior using Git‚Äôs `core.autocrlf` setting:

#### 1. **Check your current setting**
```bash
git config --get core.autocrlf
```

#### 2. **Set it based on your workflow**
- If you're on **Windows** and collaborating with others:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```
  This converts LF to CRLF on checkout and back to LF on commit.

- If you're on **Windows** but want to preserve LF:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```
  This keeps LF on commit and doesn‚Äôt change it on checkout.

- If you're on **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf false
  ```

### ‚úÖ Optional: Normalize Line Endings in Repo
If you want to enforce consistent line endings across your repo, you can use a `.gitattributes` file:

```gitattributes
*.ipynb text eol=lf
*.py text eol=lf
```

This ensures `.ipynb` and `.py` files always use LF, regardless of platform.

Let me know if you want help setting up `.gitattributes` or if you're seeing unexpected diffs because of this!
